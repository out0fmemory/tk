Backporting Tk-Cocoa from 8.6 trunk to 8.5 is a manual process. Here are the steps I followed to obtain a successful build of 8.5.10. 

1. Create a source tree for Tcl and Tk. Pull the tarballs of the release or RC version of each. 

2. The baseline for the Tk-Cocoa backport is https://github.com/das/tcltk/tree/de-carbon-8-5--this tarball is the last backport prepared by Daniel Steffen and is the basis for subsequent releases, cf. 8.5.10. 

3. Move the "macosx" directory in the release port out of the way and replace with either the macosx directory from the de-carbon-8-5 tarball or a subsequent 8.5 release of Tk-Cocoa. 

3. Replace certain files in other subdirectories of the release source tree with those from the Tk-Cocoa tarball, as they work better with Tk-Cocoa: 

unix/aclocal.m4
unix/configure
unix/configure.in
unix/Makefile.in
unix/tcl.m4
xlib/xgc.c
generic/tk.decls
generic/tkPlatDecls.h

Check Sourceforge and/or Fossil for recent commits in Tk-Cocoa; these changes should be backported to the corresponding 8.5 file. This most likely will have to be done manually. 

Try building the package and running the widget demo--if it works, then call it ready for release.
